This document details the completed work for the Embeddable AI Customer Support Widget, addressing each core requirement and consideration outlined in the "Technical Interview Task" document.

## 1. Embeddable Widget

**Requirements Met:**

- **Create a lightweight, embeddable JavaScript widget that works across different platforms:** Fulfilled. The widget is integrated using a simple script tag, making it embeddable across various platforms like Wix, WordPress, and Next.js.
- **Should be easily integrated with a simple script tag or component:** Fulfilled. Integration is achieved by including a `<script>` tag with `window.ChatbotWidgetConfig` for configuration.
- **Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop:** Fulfilled. The chatbot is described as highly professional and responsive to all screen sizes.
- **Customizable styling to match different websites:** Fulfilled. Styling (colors), title, backend URL, and other parameters are customizable through the `ChatbotWidgetConfig` object in the script tag.
- **Minimal impact on host website performance:** Implicitly addressed by using a lightweight JavaScript approach and scoped CSS.

**Demo**

    `<script>`
      window.ChatbotWidgetConfig = {
        colors: {
          primary: "#009688",
          primaryDark: "#00695c",
          accent: "#b2dfdb",
        },
        emailJsUserId: "QUgX6iwMF67qdwdWz",
        emailJsServiceId: "service_5azqk76",
        emailJsSupportTemplateId: "template_yatg54g", // notification to support desk
        emailJsUserTemplateId: "template_yatg54g", // confirmation to requester
        title: "Embedded Chatbot", // Name of the chatbot displayed on the title
        backendBaseUrl: "http://localhost:8000", // Backend URL
        googleClientId: "623127930807-cku8teni1657tg5poqn467becavouts8.apps.googleusercontent.com",
        hostUrl: "https://crumblcookies.com/", // Targetted Company
        hostDescription: "Crumbl Cookies is a cookie company that sells cookies", // Description of the targetted company
        calendlyUrl: "https://calendly.com/eqan-ahmad123/customer-agent", // Calendly URL to host meetings
      };
    `</script>`

**Implementation Details:**

- The chatbot uses scoped CSS, ensuring that its styling only affects the parent-defined root div and avoids conflicts with the host website's CSS.

## 2. AI Chat Interface

**Requirements Met:**

- **Real-time chat interface with the AI:** Fulfilled. The chatbot provides a real-time chat experience.
- **AI should provide contextual responses about the company/website:** Fulfilled. The AI (Google Gemini Flash 2.0 with Google Search support) uses the provided `hostUrl` and `hostDescription` to gather real-time information about the company for contextual responses.
- **Support for rich responses (buttons, forms, calendar pickers):** Fulfilled. The chatbot supports in-built calendar (Calendly scheduling) and forms (human handoff), and has some support for Markdown.
- **Chat history within the session:** Fulfilled. Chat history within the session is retained.

  </tr>
</table>

**Implementation Details:**

- PostgreSQL is the chosen database for logging interactions in local development but Supabase provides instance of PostgreSQL in production so wouldn't be an issue. Furthermore Sentry is chosen for error and issues logging of the APIs.

## Technical Stack Requirements

**Backend:**

- **Database:** PostgreSQL 14.
- **LLM:** Google Gemini Flash 2.0 (via OpenRouter API, with Google Search Support enabled).
- **APIs:** Email service (EmailJS[Used in Frontend]), Calendly (instead of Google Calendar API).
- **Framework:** FAST API with Python.
- **Other:** Alembic(Data Migrations), Sentry(Issues Logging), Rate Limiter, Google Authentication, Ruff(Python Linter), Pydantic(Typing Within Python), SQL Alchemy(ORM).

**Frontend:**

- **Widget:** Vanilla JS.
- **Styling:** Scoped CSS.
- **Build:** Bundling for easy distribution.
- **Other:** EmailJS, Calendly, Google Authentication, Markdown parser, Emoji Picker, HTML.

## Architecture Considerations for Future

- **Appointment Rescheduling:** Already handled by Calendly, which offers API support for this.
- **Internal Database Queries:** Easily attachable using SQL Alchemy ORM with Alembic migrations or via API calls.
- **Live Agent Handoff:** A flag or quick email notification to a human agent, with a real-time websocket connection if availability is confirmed, can facilitate seamless transition.
- **Multi-language Support:** Easily done with the prompt.
- **Advanced Analytics:** Basic analytics are implemented, with potential for improvement on the analytics module or integration with tools like Google Analytics. Sentry  also used for advanced issue related analytics.

**Overall Architecture:**

- The backend infrastructure is built on a "screaming architecture," emphasizing modularity and ease of modification. Furthermore OOP(Object Oriented Programming) is being utilized for service modules which can allow us for easy import of modules in other services and Functional Programming for REST APIs.
- The chatbot is designed to be highly modular, allowing most changes to be handled by adjusting frontend parameters, with the backend automatically adapting.

## Questions to Consider

1. **How will you handle widget styling conflicts with host websites?**

   - Handled by using scoped CSS, where the parent-defined div is considered the root, ensuring only its particular CSS is modified.
2. **What happens when Google Calendar API is unavailable?**

   - Not directly applicable as Calendly is used. Calendly's service availability would be the concern, and it's a robust, proven solution.
3. **How will you manage conversation context for the AI?**

   - Chat history within the session is retained. The AI leverages Google Gemini Flash 2.0 with Google Search support and is provided with `hostUrl` and `hostDescription` for real-time contextual information.
4. **What security measures will you implement?**

   - Google OAuthentication, Rate limiting for API calls, CORS configuration, token-based authentication for requests, and payload limits are implemented. Sentry is also used for real-time system failure updates and bug tracking.
5. **How will you handle different timezones for calendar bookings?**

   - Handled inherently by Calendly's built-in functionality

## Future Considerations

Shifting Calendly and Emai notification systems to backend via APIs for enhanced security, but need to find a way on how to automtically get calendly API key and email service credentials from the user. So we can stop people from getting their hands on even public API's and URLs.
